# EXPERIENCE — the agent's accumulated experience

> The agent's growing log of lessons. **Externalized memory of *what works and what doesn't*** — so a
> fresh, context-less session (or an autonomous loop) never repeats a dead end. Consult it BEFORE a task;
> append to it AFTER a meaningful attempt (success **or** failure). Grep, don't scroll.
>
> **Tags live inline on every entry** (not in a central list) — so one grep finds the experiences directly:
> `grep '#loop' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep -i '#context\|#build' EXPERIENCE.md` · `grep '❌' -A4 EXPERIENCE.md`
> · `grep 'EXP-0007' EXPERIENCE.md`. Reuse an existing tag where one fits (grep to see what's in use).
>
> **Entry format (keep it short and grep-friendly).** Newest on top. Every entry starts with a stable id,
> an ISO date, an outcome marker (`✅` / `❌` / `❌→✅`), and inline `#tags`:
>

> **Repro:** the ready-to-run command/check that verifies or applies the lesson — a weak session
>   executes a pasted command reliably, an essay it won't act on. REQUIRED since 2.1: a lesson
>   with no Repro line is not accepted (field-proven: lessons with a Repro command get executed,
>   essay-lessons get read and ignored). If the lesson genuinely has no command, say what to
>   OBSERVE instead — but say it as an action.
> **Trigger:** for class-level lessons — the decision point that must invoke this lesson, as
>   "writing X → run Y" (the lesson names WHERE it applies, instead of hoping to be remembered).
> **Not for:** the lesson's validity range — where it does NOT apply. A documented lesson is still a
>   hypothesis; applied outside its range it kills good ideas.

> **A lesson that repeats is a lesson that failed as text.** When the same class recurs in NEW code
> after its entry was recorded, the journal has proven insufficient — the lesson MUST become

> written 6–17 times in different words, 5.8 % mechanized): `node .kaif/tools/kaif-experience-lint.mjs
> check` reads the `class:` field as the UNIT of recurrence and reddens on the SECOND failure entry of
> one class with no `mechanized:`, naming the class and both entries by id. Two fates clear it, both
> WRITTEN: name the guard in the entry (`mechanized: <the tool>`), or re-check the price once for the
> WHOLE class and declare it — `<!-- class-ok: <slug> — <why it is not cheaply possible> -->` (an empty
> declaration is itself a finding; the declared classes are printed on the summary line and that list
> only shrinks). A third record is never a fate. It also warns when
> `mechanized:` names a command this project does not contain, and when a slug is outside the list
> below; `--shrink EXP-NNNN` collapses a MECHANIZED entry to one line pointing at its guard (shows by
> default, `--yes` writes — the text itself stays in the git history). The command belongs in the
> closing ritual (`/end-chat-soft`).

> **The class list of this journal** — a CONTROLLED list, not a closed one: pick a slug from it, and
> when a lesson genuinely brings a new class, add the slug here in the same write (the linter warns

## Entries

### EXP-0001 · 2026-01-01 · ✅ · #example #meta
**Context:** first task after KAIF was deployed into this project (example entry — replace with real ones).
**Tried / did:** wrote the first real lesson here in the canonical format.
**Result:** ✅ — the experience log is live and greppable.
**Lesson:** capture lessons at the level of *approach* (what worked / what to avoid), not defect detail
(that lives in `bugs/`); one short entry beats a long story.   → link: (none)
